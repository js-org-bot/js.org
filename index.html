<p class="bigger">Almost two decades after the domain <strong>js.org</strong> was registered for the first time, it finally serves its obvious purpose - the JavaScript community.</p>
   <p>Right from the beginning opinions about JavaScript varied - some people love the language, others hate it. But there should be no doubt about the <strong>awesomeness of the community</strong> that made JavaScript one of the most popular programming languages.<br>In alignment to the <strong>free-and-open</strong> mindset of the community, JS.ORG made <strong>subdomains</strong> available for developers and their projects for free. Since this first step we also focused on tracking JavaScript <strong>trends</strong> and spreading <strong>news</strong> about it.</p>

   <p><strong>CONTRIBUTIONS ARE WELCOME</strong>: If you have the passion to start a collaborative project (e.g. <strong>learn.js.org</strong>), or if you want to be a member of and contribute to JS.ORG, feel free to <a href="https://github.com/indus" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" name="GitHub user profile"><strong>contact me</strong></a>.</p>
